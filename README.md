DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

This repository contains my collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) programs, covering various foundational topics and implementations. The programs here are organized by data structure or algorithm type, and each file demonstrates a specific DSA concept.
Contents

The repository includes the following implementations:
1. Stack Implementations

    Using Arrays: Stack implementation using arrays, showcasing basic stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
    Using Linked List: Stack implementation using linked lists, demonstrating dynamic memory allocation for stack operations.

2. Queue Implementations

    Using Arrays: Queue implementation using arrays, including operations like enqueue, dequeue, and front.
    Using Linked List: Queue implementation using linked lists for dynamic memory management in queues.

3. KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm

    Implementation of the KMP algorithm for pattern matching, which efficiently searches for a substring within a string using preprocessing to improve search time.

4. nfind

    Implementation of an algorithm or function for finding specific elements or conditions, customized as needed.

5. Table Reservation

    Program to manage table reservations, possibly simulating reservation systems and demonstrating DSA concepts in real-world applications.

6. Binary Search Tree (BST)

    Implementation of a Binary Search Tree, with basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).

7. Student Detail Management

    Program to manage student details, potentially involving storage, search, and update functionalities, showcasing the use of data structures for record management.
